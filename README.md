# Cloud-Native

Cloud Native Apps:

Cloud Native application development is an approach to designing, building, and running complex and distributed systems. The approach takes full advantage of modern software development practices, tools, technologies, and cloud infrastructure. Cloud native changes the way you design, implement, deploy, and operationalize systems. We need to use Continuous Integration, container engines and orchestration.
Advantages of Cloud Native applications are improved speed, scalability, and product in cost effective way.

What is Cloud Native?

Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation provides the official definition:
Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.
We get improved speed, scalable and productivity in cost effective way.


Following are the pillars of Cloud Native 

1.	The Cloud: Cloud Native systems takes full advantage of the cloud service model

2.	Modern Design: The Twelve-Factor application is the widely accepted and used methodology for constructing cloud-based applications 

3.	Microservices: Cloud-Native systems embrace microservices, a popular architectural style for constructing modern application. Build small set of independent services that interact with the shared fabrics. Microservices provides agility. Microservices can be created upon any modern development platforms

4.	Containers: Containers are a great enabler of cloud native software. Containerizing a microservice is simple and straightforward. The code, dependencies, runtime are packaged into binary called as container image. Containers provides portability and guarantee consistency across environments. By encapsulating everything into a single package, we are isolating the code and its dependencies from the underling infrastructure. To manage these containers, we have special software called container orchestrators 

5.	Backing Services: Cloud Native systems depends upon many different ancillary resources such as data stores, message brokers, monitoring and identity services e.t.c these services are called backing services. 


6.	Automation
